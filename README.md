## About

A Markdown-editor-meets-kanban-board, built with SwiftUI, for the ultra-specific purpose of writing posts for [my blog](https://ghall.blog). 

I often have various ideas for posts, as well as several in-progress posts, that have ended up scattered across my computer because I can't find a system that works for me. Inspired by every software developer's favorite productivity tool, the kanban board, I decided to build a super rudimentary text editor around the concept to help keep my blog posts together and organized. 

I have no intention of building this project out to be anything more than it is, and don't recommend it outside of the very specific usecase of writing posts for my blog. It's quite clunky, and probablty has more than a few bugs.

I'm making the source code available on the off chance someone would like to fork it and build something cool.
